# Polish Sign Language (PSL); Polski JÄ™zyk Migowy (PJM)
<p>Polish Sign Language (PSL) is the primary language used by deaf individuals in Poland. It is used by hearing as well as hard-of-hearing individuals.
</p>The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.</p>

<p> Developing computer vision systems relies on complex neural network architectures that can detect subtle patterns in streaming video or images.</p>
<p><strong>In this notebook</strong>, I will train a <strong>convolutional neural network</strong> to classify images of Polish Sign Language (PSL) letters.  After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, we will train the network and test its performance.</p>
<p>In the code cell below, we load the training and test data. </p>
